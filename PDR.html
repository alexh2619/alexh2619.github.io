    <h4>Why Monitoring Matters</h4>
    <p>
      Coral reefs are some of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, yet they are in serious decline
      because of heat waves, ocean acidification, pollution, disease, and human activity. They provide
      around $375 billion a year globally in food, tourism, and coastal protection, which means the loss
      of reefs doesn’t just hurt the environment, it damages economies and communities that depend on them.
      Restoration projects are becoming more common, and new methods like 3D-printed reef structures are
      showing promise because they can mimic natural reef shapes and materials more effectively. These
      designs give coral and algae a better chance to grow and create homes for marine life. Still, even
      the most advanced artificial reefs often fail to meet their full potential without careful monitoring
      and long-term management.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is where monitoring becomes essential. By tracking data such as water temperature, pH, oxygen
      levels, and turbidity, managers can catch early signs of stress before the reef begins to collapse.
      Real-time monitoring makes it possible to take quick action, like protecting corals from sudden heat
      waves, controlling algae growth, or adjusting planting schedules to match favorable conditions. Advances
      in technology make this easier than ever, with solar-powered buoys, waterproof cameras, and sensors that
      can run continuously and collect reliable data. Continuous video monitoring also allows researchers to see
      what happens at night or during rare events, giving a more complete picture of reef health than occasional
      surveys could ever provide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our project proposes to build exactly this kind of system: a solar-powered buoy connected to sensors and
      cameras that will monitor the reef in real time and provide alerts and recommendations. The data would be
      sent to a dashboard where changes and risks could be spotted immediately. This approach closes the gap
      between simply building an artificial reef and making sure it thrives. For example, if oxygen levels drop
      at night, the system could signal that intervention is needed, or if cameras pick up biofouling, maintenance
      crews would know it’s time to clean the reef structure. In short, monitoring turns guesswork into science.
      It protects the investment of building the reef, helps ensure long-term biodiversity, and gives proof that
      the project is working. By combining smart design with continuous monitoring, our artificial reef will thrive.
